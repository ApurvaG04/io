## Open Footprint

### Environmental Profiles for Individuals, Organizations, Products and Communities

[Open Footprint Forum](https://www.opengroup.org/openfootprint-forum)  
[US EPA Carbon Footprint Calculator](https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/)

Join us in developing label widgets based on [Environmental Impact Profiles](../../io/template/) to display 24 impact areas for products and industries, states and counties, plus organizations and individuals.  

Side navigation is not yet active.  
Here's our [stand-alone version](../../localsite/info/page/) for developers.

### From Individuals to Communities
[7 top footprint tools](https://footprinthero.com/best-carbon-footprint-calculators) 

<!-- https://coolclimate.berkeley.edu/calculator Same as the following, but maybe slower -->
The [CoolClimate Footprint Calculator](https://coolclimate.org/calculator) from Berkeley ranked first out of the [Top 7 Environmental impact footprints](https://footprinthero.com/best-carbon-footprint-calculators).  It loads with averages, so you see helpful impact info immediately. [NYT article (paywall)](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/12/13/climate/climate-footprint-map-neighborhood.html) about CoolClimate spinoff.

Here's a [CoolClimate profile json](https://github.com/localsite/engine-storybook/blob/master/public/static/json/coolclimate-family.json) sample for sharing profile footprint data. View a sample [footprint.mdx](../../localsite/impact/) file which uses parameter names from [CoolClimate's Excel sheet](https://api-central.berkeley.edu/api/11).

PROJECT:

Create HTML output that matches our [environmental impact label](../../io/template/) mockup using [Cement Json](../template/feed/toy100.json) and other [OpenEPD data pulls](../../io/template/feed/).  


### Labels and Mini-Widget Impact Scores

The mini-widget label will provide a quick overview of the impact score footprint for individuals, communities and products. Scores will be displayed for impacts on air quality, water quality, energy use, land use, health and jobs created.
