## Widgets - Environmental Profile Labels - React and YAML

<a href="../../../io/template/"><img src="../../../io/template/img/label-sample.png" style="float:right; width:100%; max-width:300px; margin-left:30px; margin-bottom:30px"></a>

Implement a new standard sized [environmental label](../../io/template/) and design a layout for our <a href="../../apps/">mini-labels</a> and new <a href="../../community/projects/#cinematic">super-labels</a> using cinematic effects for our [six impact sets](../../localsite/info/).

We're building toward interactive label functionality in React.
Abrie has started React work in this <a href="https://github.com/abrie/zctaimpacts">ZCTA Impacts repo</a>. Here's the <a href="https://zctaimpacts.abrie.dev/">resulting label output</a>.
TODO: Show how industry level is determined. Shorten numbers similar to layout to the right. Drive location filters by URL hash [param values](../../localsite/).


View our [3.0 Mockup](../../../apps/smm/) to see [impact profile templates](../../../io/template/) inspired by "nutritional labels" for communities, companies, products and individuals.  


We'll be updating a metadata editing process created by Italy to edit any entity profile stored on GitHub. We're combining the best of these two label styles by placing only the number on the right side.

## Mini and Super Widgets - Layout Design and Mock-Ups

### Mini-Labels

The mini-label will provide a very brief summary of a location's score (for countries, states, counties and zips). Adjacent to each score will be a real-time data point - like air quality, water quality, energy use, land proposals, avoidable daily deaths, new jobs created.  [View&nbsp;starter&nbsp;pages](../../apps/)

### Super-Labels

This is where it gets exciting! We're creating expanded cinematic labels around themes like Marvel comics, The Last Airbender and [National&nbsp;Parks](../../apps/land/).
