## Environmental Profile Labels - React and YAML

We'll be updating a metadata editing process created by Italy to edit any entity profile stored on GitHub.  
We're combining the best of these two lable styles by placing only the number on the right side.

<div style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:15px; display: inline-block; margin-bottom:10px">
<a href="../../../io/template/"><img src="../../../io/template/img/2-labels.png" style="width:100%; max-width:600px"></a>
</div>

View our [impact profile summaries inspired by "nutritional labels"](../../../io/template/) for communities, companies, products and individuals.  

### Mini-Labels

The mini-label will provide a very brief summary of a locations score (for countries, states, counties and zips). Adjacent to each score will be a real-time data point - like air quality, water quality, energy use, land proposals, avoidable daily deaths, new jobs created.

### Super-Labels

This is where it gets exciting! We're creating expanded cinematic labels around themes like Marvel comics, The Last Airbender and [National&nbsp;Parks](../../apps/land/).
