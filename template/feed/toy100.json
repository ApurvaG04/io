(ASTM C33), Portland cement (ASTM C150), slag cement (ASTM C989), admixture (ASTM C494), batch water (ASTM C1602)\n\n## LCA Notes\nLIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT\nThis EPD is based on a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle assessment (LCA) of ready mixed\nconcrete mixes. A summary of life cycle processes included in the EPD is as\nfollows:\nRaw material supply (upstream processes): Extraction, handling, and\nprocessing of the raw materials used in production of concrete: cement,\nsupplementary cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and fine), water,\nadmixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures.\nTransportation: Transportation of these materials from supplier to the gate\nof the concrete producer.\nManufacturing (core processes): Energy used to store, batch, mix, and\ndistribute the concrete and operate the facility (concrete plant).\nWater use in mixing and distributing concrete.\nA summary of cradle-to-gate life cycle processes excluded from the EPD is as\nfollows:\nProduction, manufacture, and construction of buildings, capital goods, and\ninfrastructure.\nProduction and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete\ndelivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment.\nPersonnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).\nEnergy and water use related to company management and sales activities.\nA summary of the limitations of this EPD include the following:\nThis EPD does not report all of the environmental impacts due to\nmanufacturing of the product, but rather environmental impacts for\ncategories with established LCA-based methods to track and report.\nUnreported environmental impacts include (but are not limited to) factors\nattributable to human health, land use change, water use in the upstream\nmanufacturing process, and habitat destruction.\nThis EPD reports the results of an LCA for ‘cradle-to-gate’ analysis. Thus,\ndeclarations themselves are not comparative assertions, defined as an\nenvironmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product\nversus a competing product that performs the same function. An EPD does\nnot make any statements that the product covered by the EPD is better or\nworse than any other product.\nIn order to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing, additional\nanalysis is required.\nLife cycle impact assessment results are relative expressions and do not\npredict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds, safety\nmargins, or risks.\nNote: The product manufacturer has the option of declaring additional information\nabout their product including conformance with any other sustainability certification\nprograms that often have performance and prescriptive requirements that aim to\nillustrate environmental best practices that cannot be captured by LCA.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nPortland cement: Portland Concrete

(ASTM C33), Portland cement (ASTM C150), slag cement (ASTM C989), admixture (ASTM C494), batch water (ASTM C1602)\n\n## LCA Notes\nLIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT\nThis EPD is based on a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle assessment (LCA) of ready mixed\nconcrete mixes. A summary of life cycle processes included in the EPD is as\nfollows:\nRaw material supply (upstream processes): Extraction, handling, and\nprocessing of the raw materials used in production of concrete: cement,\nsupplementary cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and fine), water,\nadmixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures.\nTransportation: Transportation of these materials from supplier to the gate\nof the concrete producer.\nManufacturing (core processes): Energy used to store, batch, mix, and\ndistribute the concrete and operate the facility (concrete plant).\nWater use in mixing and distributing concrete.\nA summary of cradle-to-gate life cycle processes excluded from the EPD is as\nfollows:\nProduction, manufacture, and construction of buildings, capital goods, and\ninfrastructure.\nProduction and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete\ndelivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment.\nPersonnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).\nEnergy and water use related to company management and sales activities.\nA summary of the limitations of this EPD include the following:\nThis EPD does not report all of the environmental impacts due to\nmanufacturing of the product, but rather environmental impacts for\ncategories with established LCA-based methods to track and report.\nUnreported environmental impacts include (but are not limited to) factors\nattributable to human health, land use change, water use in the upstream\nmanufacturing process, and habitat destruction.\nThis EPD reports the results of an LCA for ‘cradle-to-gate’ analysis. Thus,\ndeclarations themselves are not comparative assertions, defined as an\nenvironmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product\nversus a competing product that performs the same function. An EPD does\nnot make any statements that the product covered by the EPD is better or\nworse than any other product.\nIn order to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing, additional\nanalysis is required.\nLife cycle impact assessment results are relative expressions and do not\npredict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds, safety\nmargins, or risks.\nNote: The product manufacturer has the option of declaring additional information\nabout their product including conformance with any other sustainability certification\nprograms that often have performance and prescriptive requirements that aim to\nillustrate environmental best practices that cannot be captured by LCA.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nPortland cement: Portland Concrete

(ASTM C33), Portland cement (ASTM C150), slag cement (ASTM C989), admixture (ASTM C494), batch water (ASTM C1602)\n\n## LCA Notes\nLIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT\nThis EPD is based on a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle assessment (LCA) of ready mixed\nconcrete mixes. A summary of life cycle processes included in the EPD is as\nfollows:\nRaw material supply (upstream processes): Extraction, handling, and\nprocessing of the raw materials used in production of concrete: cement,\nsupplementary cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and fine), water,\nadmixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures.\nTransportation: Transportation of these materials from supplier to the gate\nof the concrete producer.\nManufacturing (core processes): Energy used to store, batch, mix, and\ndistribute the concrete and operate the facility (concrete plant).\nWater use in mixing and distributing concrete.\nA summary of cradle-to-gate life cycle processes excluded from the EPD is as\nfollows:\nProduction, manufacture, and construction of buildings, capital goods, and\ninfrastructure.\nProduction and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete\ndelivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment.\nPersonnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).\nEnergy and water use related to company management and sales activities.\nA summary of the limitations of this EPD include the following:\nThis EPD does not report all of the environmental impacts due to\nmanufacturing of the product, but rather environmental impacts for\ncategories with established LCA-based methods to track and report.\nUnreported environmental impacts include (but are not limited to) factors\nattributable to human health, land use change, water use in the upstream\nmanufacturing process, and habitat destruction.\nThis EPD reports the results of an LCA for ‘cradle-to-gate’ analysis. Thus,\ndeclarations themselves are not comparative assertions, defined as an\nenvironmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product\nversus a competing product that performs the same function. An EPD does\nnot make any statements that the product covered by the EPD is better or\nworse than any other product.\nIn order to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing, additional\nanalysis is required.\nLife cycle impact assessment results are relative expressions and do not\npredict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds, safety\nmargins, or risks.\nNote: The product manufacturer has the option of declaring additional information\nabout their product including conformance with any other sustainability certification\nprograms that often have performance and prescriptive requirements that aim to\nillustrate environmental best practices that cannot be captured by LCA.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nPortland cement: Portland Concrete

(ASTM C33), Portland cement (ASTM C150), slag cement (ASTM C989), admixture (ASTM C494), batch water (ASTM C1602)\n\n## LCA Notes\nLIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT\nThis EPD is based on a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle assessment (LCA) of ready mixed\nconcrete mixes. A summary of life cycle processes included in the EPD is as\nfollows:\nRaw material supply (upstream processes): Extraction, handling, and\nprocessing of the raw materials used in production of concrete: cement,\nsupplementary cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and fine), water,\nadmixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures.\nTransportation: Transportation of these materials from supplier to the gate\nof the concrete producer.\nManufacturing (core processes): Energy used to store, batch, mix, and\ndistribute the concrete and operate the facility (concrete plant).\nWater use in mixing and distributing concrete.\nA summary of cradle-to-gate life cycle processes excluded from the EPD is as\nfollows:\nProduction, manufacture, and construction of buildings, capital goods, and\ninfrastructure.\nProduction and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete\ndelivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment.\nPersonnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).\nEnergy and water use related to company management and sales activities.\nA summary of the limitations of this EPD include the following:\nThis EPD does not report all of the environmental impacts due to\nmanufacturing of the product, but rather environmental impacts for\ncategories with established LCA-based methods to track and report.\nUnreported environmental impacts include (but are not limited to) factors\nattributable to human health, land use change, water use in the upstream\nmanufacturing process, and habitat destruction.\nThis EPD reports the results of an LCA for ‘cradle-to-gate’ analysis. Thus,\ndeclarations themselves are not comparative assertions, defined as an\nenvironmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product\nversus a competing product that performs the same function. An EPD does\nnot make any statements that the product covered by the EPD is better or\nworse than any other product.\nIn order to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing, additional\nanalysis is required.\nLife cycle impact assessment results are relative expressions and do not\npredict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds, safety\nmargins, or risks.\nNote: The product manufacturer has the option of declaring additional information\nabout their product including conformance with any other sustainability certification\nprograms that often have performance and prescriptive requirements that aim to\nillustrate environmental best practices that cannot be captured by LCA.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nPortland cement: Portland Concrete

(ASTM C150), slag cement (ASTM C989), admixture (ASTM C494), batch water (ASTM C1602)\n\n## LCA Notes\nLIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT\nThis EPD is based on a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle assessment (LCA) of ready mixed\nconcrete mixes. A summary of life cycle processes included in the EPD is as\nfollows:\nRaw material supply (upstream processes): Extraction, handling, and\nprocessing of the raw materials used in production of concrete: cement,\nsupplementary cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and fine), water,\nadmixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures.\nTransportation: Transportation of these materials from supplier to the gate\nof the concrete producer.\nManufacturing (core processes): Energy used to store, batch, mix, and\ndistribute the concrete and operate the facility (concrete plant).\nWater use in mixing and distributing concrete.\nA summary of cradle-to-gate life cycle processes excluded from the EPD is as\nfollows:\nProduction, manufacture, and construction of buildings, capital goods, and\ninfrastructure.\nProduction and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete\ndelivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment.\nPersonnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).\nEnergy and water use related to company management and sales activities.\nA summary of the limitations of this EPD include the following:\nThis EPD does not report all of the environmental impacts due to\nmanufacturing of the product, but rather environmental impacts for\ncategories with established LCA-based methods to track and report.\nUnreported environmental impacts include (but are not limited to) factors\nattributable to human health, land use change, water use in the upstream\nmanufacturing process, and habitat destruction.\nThis EPD reports the results of an LCA for ‘cradle-to-gate’ analysis. Thus,\ndeclarations themselves are not comparative assertions, defined as an\nenvironmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product\nversus a competing product that performs the same function. An EPD does\nnot make any statements that the product covered by the EPD is better or\nworse than any other product.\nIn order to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing, additional\nanalysis is required.\nLife cycle impact assessment results are relative expressions and do not\npredict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds, safety\nmargins, or risks.\nNote: The product manufacturer has the option of declaring additional information\nabout their product including conformance with any other sustainability certification\nprograms that often have performance and prescriptive requirements that aim to\nillustrate environmental best practices that cannot be captured by LCA.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nPortland cement: Portland Concrete

(ASTM C150), slag cement (ASTM C989), admixture (ASTM C494), batch water (ASTM C1602)\n\n## LCA Notes\nLIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT\nThis EPD is based on a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle assessment (LCA) of ready mixed\nconcrete mixes. A summary of life cycle processes included in the EPD is as\nfollows:\nRaw material supply (upstream processes): Extraction, handling, and\nprocessing of the raw materials used in production of concrete: cement,\nsupplementary cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and fine), water,\nadmixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures.\nTransportation: Transportation of these materials from supplier to the gate\nof the concrete producer.\nManufacturing (core processes): Energy used to store, batch, mix, and\ndistribute the concrete and operate the facility (concrete plant).\nWater use in mixing and distributing concrete.\nA summary of cradle-to-gate life cycle processes excluded from the EPD is as\nfollows:\nProduction, manufacture, and construction of buildings, capital goods, and\ninfrastructure.\nProduction and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete\ndelivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment.\nPersonnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).\nEnergy and water use related to company management and sales activities.\nA summary of the limitations of this EPD include the following:\nThis EPD does not report all of the environmental impacts due to\nmanufacturing of the product, but rather environmental impacts for\ncategories with established LCA-based methods to track and report.\nUnreported environmental impacts include (but are not limited to) factors\nattributable to human health, land use change, water use in the upstream\nmanufacturing process, and habitat destruction.\nThis EPD reports the results of an LCA for ‘cradle-to-gate’ analysis. Thus,\ndeclarations themselves are not comparative assertions, defined as an\nenvironmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product\nversus a competing product that performs the same function. An EPD does\nnot make any statements that the product covered by the EPD is better or\nworse than any other product.\nIn order to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing, additional\nanalysis is required.\nLife cycle impact assessment results are relative expressions and do not\npredict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds, safety\nmargins, or risks.\nNote: The product manufacturer has the option of declaring additional information\nabout their product including conformance with any other sustainability certification\nprograms that often have performance and prescriptive requirements that aim to\nillustrate environmental best practices that cannot be captured by LCA.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nPortland cement: Portland Concrete

(ASTM C150), slag cement (ASTM C989), admixture (ASTM C494), batch water (ASTM C1602)\n\n## LCA Notes\nLIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT\nThis EPD is based on a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle assessment (LCA) of ready mixed\nconcrete mixes. A summary of life cycle processes included in the EPD is as\nfollows:\nRaw material supply (upstream processes): Extraction, handling, and\nprocessing of the raw materials used in production of concrete: cement,\nsupplementary cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and fine), water,\nadmixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures.\nTransportation: Transportation of these materials from supplier to the gate\nof the concrete producer.\nManufacturing (core processes): Energy used to store, batch, mix, and\ndistribute the concrete and operate the facility (concrete plant).\nWater use in mixing and distributing concrete.\nA summary of cradle-to-gate life cycle processes excluded from the EPD is as\nfollows:\nProduction, manufacture, and construction of buildings, capital goods, and\ninfrastructure.\nProduction and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete\ndelivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment.\nPersonnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).\nEnergy and water use related to company management and sales activities.\nA summary of the limitations of this EPD include the following:\nThis EPD does not report all of the environmental impacts due to\nmanufacturing of the product, but rather environmental impacts for\ncategories with established LCA-based methods to track and report.\nUnreported environmental impacts include (but are not limited to) factors\nattributable to human health, land use change, water use in the upstream\nmanufacturing process, and habitat destruction.\nThis EPD reports the results of an LCA for ‘cradle-to-gate’ analysis. Thus,\ndeclarations themselves are not comparative assertions, defined as an\nenvironmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product\nversus a competing product that performs the same function. An EPD does\nnot make any statements that the product covered by the EPD is better or\nworse than any other product.\nIn order to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing, additional\nanalysis is required.\nLife cycle impact assessment results are relative expressions and do not\npredict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds, safety\nmargins, or risks.\nNote: The product manufacturer has the option of declaring additional information\nabout their product including conformance with any other sustainability certification\nprograms that often have performance and prescriptive requirements that aim to\nillustrate environmental best practices that cannot be captured by LCA.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nPortland cement: Portland Concrete

(ASTM C33), Portland cement (ASTM C150), slag cement (ASTM C989), admixture (ASTM C494), batch water (ASTM C1602)\n\n## LCA Notes\nLIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT\nThis EPD is based on a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle assessment (LCA) of ready mixed\nconcrete mixes. A summary of life cycle processes included in the EPD is as\nfollows:\nRaw material supply (upstream processes): Extraction, handling, and\nprocessing of the raw materials used in production of concrete: cement,\nsupplementary cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and fine), water,\nadmixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures.\nTransportation: Transportation of these materials from supplier to the gate\nof the concrete producer.\nManufacturing (core processes): Energy used to store, batch, mix, and\ndistribute the concrete and operate the facility (concrete plant).\nWater use in mixing and distributing concrete.\nA summary of cradle-to-gate life cycle processes excluded from the EPD is as\nfollows:\nProduction, manufacture, and construction of buildings, capital goods, and\ninfrastructure.\nProduction and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete\ndelivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment.\nPersonnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).\nEnergy and water use related to company management and sales activities.\nA summary of the limitations of this EPD include the following:\nThis EPD does not report all of the environmental impacts due to\nmanufacturing of the product, but rather environmental impacts for\ncategories with established LCA-based methods to track and report.\nUnreported environmental impacts include (but are not limited to) factors\nattributable to human health, land use change, water use in the upstream\nmanufacturing process, and habitat destruction.\nThis EPD reports the results of an LCA for ‘cradle-to-gate’ analysis. Thus,\ndeclarations themselves are not comparative assertions, defined as an\nenvironmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product\nversus a competing product that performs the same function. An EPD does\nnot make any statements that the product covered by the EPD is better or\nworse than any other product.\nIn order to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing, additional\nanalysis is required.\nLife cycle impact assessment results are relative expressions and do not\npredict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds, safety\nmargins, or risks.\nNote: The product manufacturer has the option of declaring additional information\nabout their product including conformance with any other sustainability certification\nprograms that often have performance and prescriptive requirements that aim to\nillustrate environmental best practices that cannot be captured by LCA.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nPortland cement: Portland Concrete

(ASTM C150), slag cement (ASTM C989), batch water (ASTM C1602), admixture (ASTM C494)\n\n## LCA Notes\nLIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT\nThis EPD is based on a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle assessment (LCA) of ready mixed\nconcrete mixes. A summary of life cycle processes included in the EPD is as\nfollows:\nRaw material supply (upstream processes): Extraction, handling, and\nprocessing of the raw materials used in production of concrete: cement,\nsupplementary cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and fine), water,\nadmixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures.\nTransportation: Transportation of these materials from supplier to the gate\nof the concrete producer.\nManufacturing (core processes): Energy used to store, batch, mix, and\ndistribute the concrete and operate the facility (concrete plant).\nWater use in mixing and distributing concrete.\nA summary of cradle-to-gate life cycle processes excluded from the EPD is as\nfollows:\nProduction, manufacture, and construction of buildings, capital goods, and\ninfrastructure.\nProduction and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete\ndelivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment.\nPersonnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).\nEnergy and water use related to company management and sales activities.\nA summary of the limitations of this EPD include the following:\nThis EPD does not report all of the environmental impacts due to\nmanufacturing of the product, but rather environmental impacts for\ncategories with established LCA-based methods to track and report.\nUnreported environmental impacts include (but are not limited to) factors\nattributable to human health, land use change, water use in the upstream\nmanufacturing process, and habitat destruction.\nThis EPD reports the results of an LCA for ‘cradle-to-gate’ analysis. Thus,\ndeclarations themselves are not comparative assertions, defined as an\nenvironmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product\nversus a competing product that performs the same function. An EPD does\nnot make any statements that the product covered by the EPD is better or\nworse than any other product.\nIn order to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing, additional\nanalysis is required.\nLife cycle impact assessment results are relative expressions and do not\npredict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds, safety\nmargins, or risks.\nNote: The product manufacturer has the option of declaring additional information\nabout their product including conformance with any other sustainability certification\nprograms that often have performance and prescriptive requirements that aim to\nillustrate environmental best practices that cannot be captured by LCA.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nPortland cement: Portland Concrete

(ASTM C150), slag cement (ASTM C989), batch water (ASTM C1602), admixture (ASTM C494)\n\n## LCA Notes\nLIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT\nThis EPD is based on a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle assessment (LCA) of ready mixed\nconcrete mixes. A summary of life cycle processes included in the EPD is as\nfollows:\nRaw material supply (upstream processes): Extraction, handling, and\nprocessing of the raw materials used in production of concrete: cement,\nsupplementary cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and fine), water,\nadmixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures.\nTransportation: Transportation of these materials from supplier to the gate\nof the concrete producer.\nManufacturing (core processes): Energy used to store, batch, mix, and\ndistribute the concrete and operate the facility (concrete plant).\nWater use in mixing and distributing concrete.\nA summary of cradle-to-gate life cycle processes excluded from the EPD is as\nfollows:\nProduction, manufacture, and construction of buildings, capital goods, and\ninfrastructure.\nProduction and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete\ndelivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment.\nPersonnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).\nEnergy and water use related to company management and sales activities.\nA summary of the limitations of this EPD include the following:\nThis EPD does not report all of the environmental impacts due to\nmanufacturing of the product, but rather environmental impacts for\ncategories with established LCA-based methods to track and report.\nUnreported environmental impacts include (but are not limited to) factors\nattributable to human health, land use change, water use in the upstream\nmanufacturing process, and habitat destruction.\nThis EPD reports the results of an LCA for ‘cradle-to-gate’ analysis. Thus,\ndeclarations themselves are not comparative assertions, defined as an\nenvironmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product\nversus a competing product that performs the same function. An EPD does\nnot make any statements that the product covered by the EPD is better or\nworse than any other product.\nIn order to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing, additional\nanalysis is required.\nLife cycle impact assessment results are relative expressions and do not\npredict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds, safety\nmargins, or risks.\nNote: The product manufacturer has the option of declaring additional information\nabout their product including conformance with any other sustainability certification\nprograms that often have performance and prescriptive requirements that aim to\nillustrate environmental best practices that cannot be captured by LCA.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nPortland cement: Portland Concrete

(ASTM C33), Portland cement (ASTM C150), slag cement\n(ASTM C989), admixture (ASTM C494), batch water (ASTM C1602)\n\n## LCA Notes\nThis EPD is based on a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle assessment (LCA) of ready mixed concrete mixes. A summary of life cycle processes included in the EPD is as follows:\nRaw material supply (upstream processes): Extraction, handling, and\nprocessing of the raw materials used in production of concrete: cement,\nsupplementary cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and fine), water,\nadmixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures.\nTransportation: Transportation of these materials from supplier to the gate\nof the concrete producer.\nManufacturing (core processes): Energy used to store, batch, mix, and\ndistribute the concrete and operate the facility (concrete plant).\nWater use in mixing and distributing concrete.\nA summary of cradle-to-gate life cycle processes excluded from the EPD is as\nfollows:\nProduction, manufacture, and construction of buildings, capital goods, and\ninfrastructure.\nProduction and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete\ndelivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment.\nPersonnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).\nEnergy and water use related to company management and sales activities.\nA summary of the limitations of this EPD include the following:\nThis EPD does not report all of the environmental impacts due to\nmanufacturing of the product, but rather environmental impacts for\ncategories with established LCA-based methods to track and report.\nUnreported environmental impacts include (but are not limited to) factors\nattributable to human health, land use change, water use in the upstream\nmanufacturing process, and habitat destruction.\nThis EPD reports the results of an LCA for ‘cradle-to-gate’ analysis. Thus,\ndeclarations themselves are not comparative assertions, defined as an\nenvironmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product\nversus a competing product that performs the same function. An EPD does\nnot make any statements that the product covered by the EPD is better or\nworse than any other product.\nIn order to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing, additional\nanalysis is required.\nLife cycle impact assessment results are relative expressions and do not\npredict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds, safety\nmargins, or risks.\nNote: The product manufacturer has the option of declaring additional information\nabout their product including conformance with any other sustainability certification\nprograms that often have performance and prescriptive requirements that aim to\nillustrate environmental best practices that cannot be captured by LCA.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nPortland cement: Portland Concrete

(ASTM C150), slag cement (ASTM C989), crushed aggregate (ASTM C33), admixture (ASTM C494), batch water (ASTM C1602)\n\n## LCA Notes\nLIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT\nThis EPD is based on a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle assessment (LCA) of ready mixed\nconcrete mixes. A summary of life cycle processes included in the EPD is as\nfollows:\nRaw material supply (upstream processes): Extraction, handling, and\nprocessing of the raw materials used in production of concrete: cement,\nsupplementary cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and fine), water,\nadmixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures.\nTransportation: Transportation of these materials from supplier to the gate\nof the concrete producer.\nManufacturing (core processes): Energy used to store, batch, mix, and\ndistribute the concrete and operate the facility (concrete plant).\nWater use in mixing and distributing concrete.\nA summary of cradle-to-gate life cycle processes excluded from the EPD is as\nfollows:\nProduction, manufacture, and construction of buildings, capital goods, and\ninfrastructure.\nProduction and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete\ndelivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment.\nPersonnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).\nEnergy and water use related to company management and sales activities.\nA summary of the limitations of this EPD include the following:\nThis EPD does not report all of the environmental impacts due to\nmanufacturing of the product, but rather environmental impacts for\ncategories with established LCA-based methods to track and report.\nUnreported environmental impacts include (but are not limited to) factors\nattributable to human health, land use change, water use in the upstream\nmanufacturing process, and habitat destruction.\nThis EPD reports the results of an LCA for ‘cradle-to-gate’ analysis. Thus,\ndeclarations themselves are not comparative assertions, defined as an\nenvironmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product\nversus a competing product that performs the same function. An EPD does\nnot make any statements that the product covered by the EPD is better or\nworse than any other product.\nIn order to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing, additional\nanalysis is required.\nLife cycle impact assessment results are relative expressions and do not\npredict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds, safety\nmargins, or risks.\nNote: The product manufacturer has the option of declaring additional information\nabout their product including conformance with any other sustainability certification\nprograms that often have performance and prescriptive requirements that aim to\nillustrate environmental best practices that cannot be captured by LCA.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nPortland cement: Portland Concrete

(ASTM C33), Portland cement (ASTM C150), slag cement (ASTM C989), admixture (ASTM C494), batch water (ASTM C1602)\n\n## LCA Notes\nLIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT\nThis EPD is based on a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle assessment (LCA) of ready mixed\nconcrete mixes. A summary of life cycle processes included in the EPD is as\nfollows:\nRaw material supply (upstream processes): Extraction, handling, and\nprocessing of the raw materials used in production of concrete: cement,\nsupplementary cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and fine), water,\nadmixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures.\nTransportation: Transportation of these materials from supplier to the gate\nof the concrete producer.\nManufacturing (core processes): Energy used to store, batch, mix, and\ndistribute the concrete and operate the facility (concrete plant).\nWater use in mixing and distributing concrete.\nA summary of cradle-to-gate life cycle processes excluded from the EPD is as\nfollows:\nProduction, manufacture, and construction of buildings, capital goods, and\ninfrastructure.\nProduction and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete\ndelivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment.\nPersonnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).\nEnergy and water use related to company management and sales activities.\nA summary of the limitations of this EPD include the following:\nThis EPD does not report all of the environmental impacts due to\nmanufacturing of the product, but rather environmental impacts for\ncategories with established LCA-based methods to track and report.\nUnreported environmental impacts include (but are not limited to) factors\nattributable to human health, land use change, water use in the upstream\nmanufacturing process, and habitat destruction.\nThis EPD reports the results of an LCA for ‘cradle-to-gate’ analysis. Thus,\ndeclarations themselves are not comparative assertions, defined as an\nenvironmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product\nversus a competing product that performs the same function. An EPD does\nnot make any statements that the product covered by the EPD is better or\nworse than any other product.\nIn order to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing, additional\nanalysis is required.\nLife cycle impact assessment results are relative expressions and do not\npredict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds, safety\nmargins, or risks.\nNote: The product manufacturer has the option of declaring additional information\nabout their product including conformance with any other sustainability certification\nprograms that often have performance and prescriptive requirements that aim to\nillustrate environmental best practices that cannot be captured by LCA.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nPortland cement: Portland Concrete

(ASTM C150), crushed aggregate (ASTM C33), slag cement (ASTM C989), admixture (ASTM C494), batch water (ASTM C1602)\n\n## LCA Notes\nLIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT\nThis EPD is based on a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle assessment (LCA) of ready mixed\nconcrete mixes. A summary of life cycle processes included in the EPD is as\nfollows:\nRaw material supply (upstream processes): Extraction, handling, and\nprocessing of the raw materials used in production of concrete: cement,\nsupplementary cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and fine), water,\nadmixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures.\nTransportation: Transportation of these materials from supplier to the gate\nof the concrete producer.\nManufacturing (core processes): Energy used to store, batch, mix, and\ndistribute the concrete and operate the facility (concrete plant).\nWater use in mixing and distributing concrete.\nA summary of cradle-to-gate life cycle processes excluded from the EPD is as\nfollows:\nProduction, manufacture, and construction of buildings, capital goods, and\ninfrastructure.\nProduction and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete\ndelivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment.\nPersonnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).\nEnergy and water use related to company management and sales activities.\nA summary of the limitations of this EPD include the following:\nThis EPD does not report all of the environmental impacts due to\nmanufacturing of the product, but rather environmental impacts for\ncategories with established LCA-based methods to track and report.\nUnreported environmental impacts include (but are not limited to) factors\nattributable to human health, land use change, water use in the upstream\nmanufacturing process, and habitat destruction.\nThis EPD reports the results of an LCA for ‘cradle-to-gate’ analysis. Thus,\ndeclarations themselves are not comparative assertions, defined as an\nenvironmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product\nversus a competing product that performs the same function. An EPD does\nnot make any statements that the product covered by the EPD is better or\nworse than any other product.\nIn order to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing, additional\nanalysis is required.\nLife cycle impact assessment results are relative expressions and do not\npredict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds, safety\nmargins, or risks.\nNote: The product manufacturer has the option of declaring additional information\nabout their product including conformance with any other sustainability certification\nprograms that often have performance and prescriptive requirements that aim to\nillustrate environmental best practices that cannot be captured by LCA.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nPortland cement: Portland Concrete

(ASTM C150), crushed aggregate (ASTM C33), slag cement (ASTM C989), admixture (ASTM C494), batch water (ASTM C1602)\n\n## LCA Notes\nLIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT\nThis EPD is based on a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle assessment (LCA) of ready mixed\nconcrete mixes. A summary of life cycle processes included in the EPD is as\nfollows:\nRaw material supply (upstream processes): Extraction, handling, and\nprocessing of the raw materials used in production of concrete: cement,\nsupplementary cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and fine), water,\nadmixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures.\nTransportation: Transportation of these materials from supplier to the gate\nof the concrete producer.\nManufacturing (core processes): Energy used to store, batch, mix, and\ndistribute the concrete and operate the facility (concrete plant).\nWater use in mixing and distributing concrete.\nA summary of cradle-to-gate life cycle processes excluded from the EPD is as\nfollows:\nProduction, manufacture, and construction of buildings, capital goods, and\ninfrastructure.\nProduction and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete\ndelivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment.\nPersonnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).\nEnergy and water use related to company management and sales activities.\nA summary of the limitations of this EPD include the following:\nThis EPD does not report all of the environmental impacts due to\nmanufacturing of the product, but rather environmental impacts for\ncategories with established LCA-based methods to track and report.\nUnreported environmental impacts include (but are not limited to) factors\nattributable to human health, land use change, water use in the upstream\nmanufacturing process, and habitat destruction.\nThis EPD reports the results of an LCA for ‘cradle-to-gate’ analysis. Thus,\ndeclarations themselves are not comparative assertions, defined as an\nenvironmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product\nversus a competing product that performs the same function. An EPD does\nnot make any statements that the product covered by the EPD is better or\nworse than any other product.\nIn order to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing, additional\nanalysis is required.\nLife cycle impact assessment results are relative expressions and do not\npredict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds, safety\nmargins, or risks.\nNote: The product manufacturer has the option of declaring additional information\nabout their product including conformance with any other sustainability certification\nprograms that often have performance and prescriptive requirements that aim to\nillustrate environmental best practices that cannot be captured by LCA.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nPortland cement: Portland Concrete

(ASTM C33), Portland cement (ASTM C150), slag cement (ASTM C989), admixture (ASTM C494), batch water (ASTM C1602)\n\n## LCA Notes\nLIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT\nThis EPD is based on a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle assessment (LCA) of ready mixed\nconcrete mixes. A summary of life cycle processes included in the EPD is as\nfollows:\nRaw material supply (upstream processes): Extraction, handling, and\nprocessing of the raw materials used in production of concrete: cement,\nsupplementary cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and fine), water,\nadmixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures.\nTransportation: Transportation of these materials from supplier to the gate\nof the concrete producer.\nManufacturing (core processes): Energy used to store, batch, mix, and\ndistribute the concrete and operate the facility (concrete plant).\nWater use in mixing and distributing concrete.\nA summary of cradle-to-gate life cycle processes excluded from the EPD is as\nfollows:\nProduction, manufacture, and construction of buildings, capital goods, and\ninfrastructure.\nProduction and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete\ndelivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment.\nPersonnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).\nEnergy and water use related to company management and sales activities.\nA summary of the limitations of this EPD include the following:\nThis EPD does not report all of the environmental impacts due to\nmanufacturing of the product, but rather environmental impacts for\ncategories with established LCA-based methods to track and report.\nUnreported environmental impacts include (but are not limited to) factors\nattributable to human health, land use change, water use in the upstream\nmanufacturing process, and habitat destruction.\nThis EPD reports the results of an LCA for ‘cradle-to-gate’ analysis. Thus,\ndeclarations themselves are not comparative assertions, defined as an\nenvironmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product\nversus a competing product that performs the same function. An EPD does\nnot make any statements that the product covered by the EPD is better or\nworse than any other product.\nIn order to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing, additional\nanalysis is required.\nLife cycle impact assessment results are relative expressions and do not\npredict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds, safety\nmargins, or risks.\nNote: The product manufacturer has the option of declaring additional information\nabout their product including conformance with any other sustainability certification\nprograms that often have performance and prescriptive requirements that aim to\nillustrate environmental best practices that cannot be captured by LCA.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nPortland cement: Portland Concrete

(ASTM C33), Portland cement (ASTM C150), slag cement (ASTM C989), admixture (ASTM C494), batch water (ASTM C1602)\n\n## LCA Notes\nLIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT\nThis EPD is based on a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle assessment (LCA) of ready mixed\nconcrete mixes. A summary of life cycle processes included in the EPD is as\nfollows:\nRaw material supply (upstream processes): Extraction, handling, and\nprocessing of the raw materials used in production of concrete: cement,\nsupplementary cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and fine), water,\nadmixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures.\nTransportation: Transportation of these materials from supplier to the gate\nof the concrete producer.\nManufacturing (core processes): Energy used to store, batch, mix, and\ndistribute the concrete and operate the facility (concrete plant).\nWater use in mixing and distributing concrete.\nA summary of cradle-to-gate life cycle processes excluded from the EPD is as\nfollows:\nProduction, manufacture, and construction of buildings, capital goods, and\ninfrastructure.\nProduction and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete\ndelivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment.\nPersonnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).\nEnergy and water use related to company management and sales activities.\nA summary of the limitations of this EPD include the following:\nThis EPD does not report all of the environmental impacts due to\nmanufacturing of the product, but rather environmental impacts for\ncategories with established LCA-based methods to track and report.\nUnreported environmental impacts include (but are not limited to) factors\nattributable to human health, land use change, water use in the upstream\nmanufacturing process, and habitat destruction.\nThis EPD reports the results of an LCA for ‘cradle-to-gate’ analysis. Thus,\ndeclarations themselves are not comparative assertions, defined as an\nenvironmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product\nversus a competing product that performs the same function. An EPD does\nnot make any statements that the product covered by the EPD is better or\nworse than any other product.\nIn order to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing, additional\nanalysis is required.\nLife cycle impact assessment results are relative expressions and do not\npredict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds, safety\nmargins, or risks.\nNote: The product manufacturer has the option of declaring additional information\nabout their product including conformance with any other sustainability certification\nprograms that often have performance and prescriptive requirements that aim to\nillustrate environmental best practices that cannot be captured by LCA.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nPortland cement: Portland Concrete

(ASTM C33), Portland cement (ASTM C150), batch water (ASTM C1602), slag cement (ASTM C989), admixture (ASTM C494)\n\n## LCA Notes\nLIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT\nThis EPD is based on a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle assessment (LCA) of ready mixed\nconcrete mixes. A summary of life cycle processes included in the EPD is as\nfollows:\nRaw material supply (upstream processes): Extraction, handling, and\nprocessing of the raw materials used in production of concrete: cement,\nsupplementary cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and fine), water,\nadmixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures.\nTransportation: Transportation of these materials from supplier to the gate\nof the concrete producer.\nManufacturing (core processes): Energy used to store, batch, mix, and\ndistribute the concrete and operate the facility (concrete plant).\nWater use in mixing and distributing concrete.\nA summary of cradle-to-gate life cycle processes excluded from the EPD is as\nfollows:\nProduction, manufacture, and construction of buildings, capital goods, and\ninfrastructure.\nProduction and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete\ndelivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment.\nPersonnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).\nEnergy and water use related to company management and sales activities.\nA summary of the limitations of this EPD include the following:\nThis EPD does not report all of the environmental impacts due to\nmanufacturing of the product, but rather environmental impacts for\ncategories with established LCA-based methods to track and report.\nUnreported environmental impacts include (but are not limited to) factors\nattributable to human health, land use change, water use in the upstream\nmanufacturing process, and habitat destruction.\nThis EPD reports the results of an LCA for ‘cradle-to-gate’ analysis. Thus,\ndeclarations themselves are not comparative assertions, defined as an\nenvironmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product\nversus a competing product that performs the same function. An EPD does\nnot make any statements that the product covered by the EPD is better or\nworse than any other product.\nIn order to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing, additional\nanalysis is required.\nLife cycle impact assessment results are relative expressions and do not\npredict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds, safety\nmargins, or risks.\nNote: The product manufacturer has the option of declaring additional information\nabout their product including conformance with any other sustainability certification\nprograms that often have performance and prescriptive requirements that aim to\nillustrate environmental best practices that cannot be captured by LCA.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nPortland cement: Portland Concrete

(ASTM C150), slag cement (ASTM C989), admixture (ASTM C494), batch water (ASTM C1602)\n\n## LCA Notes\nLIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT\nThis EPD is based on a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle assessment (LCA) of ready mixed\nconcrete mixes. A summary of life cycle processes included in the EPD is as\nfollows:\nRaw material supply (upstream processes): Extraction, handling, and\nprocessing of the raw materials used in production of concrete: cement,\nsupplementary cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and fine), water,\nadmixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures.\nTransportation: Transportation of these materials from supplier to the gate\nof the concrete producer.\nManufacturing (core processes): Energy used to store, batch, mix, and\ndistribute the concrete and operate the facility (concrete plant).\nWater use in mixing and distributing concrete.\nA summary of cradle-to-gate life cycle processes excluded from the EPD is as\nfollows:\nProduction, manufacture, and construction of buildings, capital goods, and\ninfrastructure.\nProduction and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete\ndelivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment.\nPersonnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).\nEnergy and water use related to company management and sales activities.\nA summary of the limitations of this EPD include the following:\nThis EPD does not report all of the environmental impacts due to\nmanufacturing of the product, but rather environmental impacts for\ncategories with established LCA-based methods to track and report.\nUnreported environmental impacts include (but are not limited to) factors\nattributable to human health, land use change, water use in the upstream\nmanufacturing process, and habitat destruction.\nThis EPD reports the results of an LCA for ‘cradle-to-gate’ analysis. Thus,\ndeclarations themselves are not comparative assertions, defined as an\nenvironmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product\nversus a competing product that performs the same function. An EPD does\nnot make any statements that the product covered by the EPD is better or\nworse than any other product.\nIn order to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing, additional\nanalysis is required.\nLife cycle impact assessment results are relative expressions and do not\npredict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds, safety\nmargins, or risks.\nNote: The product manufacturer has the option of declaring additional information\nabout their product including conformance with any other sustainability certification\nprograms that often have performance and prescriptive requirements that aim to\nillustrate environmental best practices that cannot be captured by LCA.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nPortland cement: Portland Concrete

(ASTM C150), admixture (ASTM C494), slag cement (ASTM C989), batch water (ASTM C1602), fiber (ASTM C1116)\n\n## LCA Notes\nLIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT\nThis EPD is based on a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle assessment (LCA) of ready mixed\nconcrete mixes. A summary of life cycle processes included in the EPD is as\nfollows:\nRaw material supply (upstream processes): Extraction, handling, and\nprocessing of the raw materials used in production of concrete: cement,\nsupplementary cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and fine), water,\nadmixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures.\nTransportation: Transportation of these materials from supplier to the gate\nof the concrete producer.\nManufacturing (core processes): Energy used to store, batch, mix, and\ndistribute the concrete and operate the facility (concrete plant).\nWater use in mixing and distributing concrete.\nA summary of cradle-to-gate life cycle processes excluded from the EPD is as\nfollows:\nProduction, manufacture, and construction of buildings, capital goods, and\ninfrastructure.\nProduction and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete\ndelivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment.\nPersonnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).\nEnergy and water use related to company management and sales activities.\nA summary of the limitations of this EPD include the following:\nThis EPD does not report all of the environmental impacts due to\nmanufacturing of the product, but rather environmental impacts for\ncategories with established LCA-based methods to track and report.\nUnreported environmental impacts include (but are not limited to) factors\nattributable to human health, land use change, water use in the upstream\nmanufacturing process, and habitat destruction.\nThis EPD reports the results of an LCA for ‘cradle-to-gate’ analysis. Thus,\ndeclarations themselves are not comparative assertions, defined as an\nenvironmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product\nversus a competing product that performs the same function. An EPD does\nnot make any statements that the product covered by the EPD is better or\nworse than any other product.\nIn order to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing, additional\nanalysis is required.\nLife cycle impact assessment results are relative expressions and do not\npredict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds, safety\nmargins, or risks.\nNote: The product manufacturer has the option of declaring additional information\nabout their product including conformance with any other sustainability certification\nprograms that often have performance and prescriptive requirements that aim to\nillustrate environmental best practices that cannot be captured by LCA.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nPortland cement: Portland Concrete

(ASTM C150), slag cement (ASTM C989), admixture (ASTM C494), batch water (ASTM C1602)\n\n## LCA Notes\nLIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT\nThis EPD is based on a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle assessment (LCA) of ready mixed\nconcrete mixes. A summary of life cycle processes included in the EPD is as\nfollows:\nRaw material supply (upstream processes): Extraction, handling, and\nprocessing of the raw materials used in production of concrete: cement,\nsupplementary cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and fine), water,\nadmixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures.\nTransportation: Transportation of these materials from supplier to the gate\nof the concrete producer.\nManufacturing (core processes): Energy used to store, batch, mix, and\ndistribute the concrete and operate the facility (concrete plant).\nWater use in mixing and distributing concrete.\nA summary of cradle-to-gate life cycle processes excluded from the EPD is as\nfollows:\nProduction, manufacture, and construction of buildings, capital goods, and\ninfrastructure.\nProduction and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete\ndelivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment.\nPersonnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).\nEnergy and water use related to company management and sales activities.\nA summary of the limitations of this EPD include the following:\nThis EPD does not report all of the environmental impacts due to\nmanufacturing of the product, but rather environmental impacts for\ncategories with established LCA-based methods to track and report.\nUnreported environmental impacts include (but are not limited to) factors\nattributable to human health, land use change, water use in the upstream\nmanufacturing process, and habitat destruction.\nThis EPD reports the results of an LCA for ‘cradle-to-gate’ analysis. Thus,\ndeclarations themselves are not comparative assertions, defined as an\nenvironmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product\nversus a competing product that performs the same function. An EPD does\nnot make any statements that the product covered by the EPD is better or\nworse than any other product.\nIn order to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing, additional\nanalysis is required.\nLife cycle impact assessment results are relative expressions and do not\npredict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds, safety\nmargins, or risks.\nNote: The product manufacturer has the option of declaring additional information\nabout their product including conformance with any other sustainability certification\nprograms that often have performance and prescriptive requirements that aim to\nillustrate environmental best practices that cannot be captured by LCA.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nPortland cement: Portland Concrete
