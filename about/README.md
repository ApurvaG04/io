# About the Model

## Background
Our site uses the US Environmentally-Extended Input Output (USEEIO) model of goods and services with Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) [data](https://model.earth/data-pipeline/). The model is freely available to use by industry, academia, nonprofits, and government agencies.  In 2019, The US EPA awarded a [Regional Sustainability and Environmental Sciences Research Program (RESES)](https://www.epa.gov/research/regional-sustainability-and-environmental-sciences-research-program-reses) grant <!--(Community-driven Application Development Using USEEIO Models) to support EPA and the Georgia Center of Innovation for Energy --> to work with local communities in Georgia to build their own interfaces to the model. The tools developed are now broadly available to other organizations, states and countries.
