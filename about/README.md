# About the Model

## Background
The EPA created the US Environmentally-Extended Input Output (USEEIO) life cycle model of goods and services using Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data with EPA data to support <a href="https://www.epa.gov/smm" target="_parent">Sustainable&nbsp;Materials&nbsp;Management</a>. The model is freely available and in use by experts in industry, academia (24+ US universities), the non-profit sector, and other Federal Agencies. <!--
 From 2015-2018, the Center of Innovation for Energy partnered with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) and the Georgia Recycling Coalition to develop the first state version of the national USEEIO model.--> In 2019, EPA awarded a [Regional Sustainability and Environmental Sciences Research Program (RESES)](https://www.epa.gov/research/regional-sustainability-and-environmental-sciences-research-program-reses) grant <!--(Community-driven Application Development Using USEEIO Models) to support EPA and the Georgia Center of Innovation for Energy --> to work with local communities in Georgia to build their own interfaces to the model. The tools developed are now broadly available to other organizations, states and countries.
