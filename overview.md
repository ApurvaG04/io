# Innovative Web Applications for&nbsp;States&nbsp;and&nbsp;Communities 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is partnering with <span style="display:none" class="georgia">the Georgia Center for Innovation for Energy Technology and Georgia Tech to work with</span> local <span style="display:none" class="georgia">Georgia</span> communities to apply web tools that report the environmental and economic impact of industries in both local communities, state regions and the entire US using 24 indicators, including jobs, value-added, air quality, climate impact, energy use, water use and land use. Using an economy-wide input-output model of industries, households and the environment, the impact tools help communities identify opportunities for both economic growth and environmental improvements.

## Opportunities for communities include

- Being one of the first communities in the US to take advantage of the EPA's new input-ouput model

- Creating an economic development tool for community decision-making that includes environmental aspects

- Looking in depth at your community's total footprint

- Evaluating prospective industries and the potential jobs they could directly 
 and indirectly create, and looking at their potential environmental performance
 
- Determining how technological improvements in your community's industries, utilities, or consumption patterns could reduce its footprint
