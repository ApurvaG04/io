# Input-Output Charts

## Viewing on localhost

The "io" repo shares js and css folders with the [modelearth/localsite](https://github.com/modelearth/localsite/) repo.

Place both "io" and "localsite" in your webroot directory. 

## Start a local web server

1. Open a command prompt in the webroot folder that contains both "io" and "community".

2. Enter `python -m http.server 8887` 

3. View at [http://localhost:8887/io/charts](http://localhost:8887/io/charts/)  

If you don't have Python installed, view [Localhost Setup Steps](https://model.earth/localsite/start/)
