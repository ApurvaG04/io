# Python and Conda Notes

Check if you are running pyenv.

	pyenv --version

If so, upgrade your python versions in pyenv to 3.12 or later.

	pyenv install 3.12
	pyenv global 3.12

If an old version of python is blocking the install.


## Conda

You can try using a cmd to upgrade, but you may need to download.

	conda update -n base -c defaults conda
