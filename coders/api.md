# API's for Workflow

We're creating embedable [input-output apps](../../community/tools/) for product lifecycle analysis and workflow automation using [BlueSky Feeds](../../feed/view/#feed=bsky).

We're using [Open WebUI](../../projects/src/) to intereact with data and visualizations from our [Google Data Commons UN Goal Timelines](../../data-commons/)

You can generate [images and video](../../data-pipeline/research/stream/) from our Requests Storyboard using [.csv file prompts](https://github.com/modelearth/requests).

We're [visualizing nutritious meals](../../data-pipeline/research/stream/) using [USDA API food profiles](https://model.earth/data-commons/dist/food) within our [YAML/JSON label parser](../../io/template/parser/) pulled from the [USDA API](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html).

We're displaying [local 311 requests](https://normansj.github.io/local-view-request/src/location/mylocation.html) in our [Feed Player](../../feed/view/#feed=311) from the [SeeClickFix open311 API](https://dev.seeclickfix.com)

Project bounty funding can be managed using the [OpenCollective API GraphQL](https://graphql-docs-v2.opencollective.com/access) which is accessible via [altairgraphql.dev](https://altairgraphql.dev).

[Connect with us in Democracy Lab](../../io/coders/) and get started by [setting up your localsite](../../localsite/start/steps/) to contribute to [our repos](https://github.com/ModelEarth?tab=repositories) and [colabs](../../RealityStream/).
