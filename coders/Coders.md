<a href="https://www.meetup.com/codeforatlanta">Neighborhood.org at Code for Atlanta</a> - We're hacking our way through React to become better UX/UI designers!

Please get one of the following REACT builds running on your local machine before we meet. Help update any missing set-up documentation.

1. **Pull an API to static JSON files**  
Copy how the [EPA widgets](../../io/charts/) save static JSON files using <code>npm run download</code> and apply to the Building Transparency API.  You might need a bearer token - see our [openEPD pull notes](../../io/template/feed/).  Change from [toy json](../template/feed/toy100.json) to the new static files to speed up <a href="../../../io/template/feed/">Building Transparency API Display</a>
<!--- 1st and 3rd Tuesday of the month at 7 PM ET<br>-->

2. **Save an edit in an HTML form directly to GitHub**  
Weâ€™re updating the Italian PublicCode-editor to add code devloped by Code for America to edit YAML files directly on GitHub. <a href="../../community/projects/#profile-editor">Project Details</a>  

3. **Use TypeScript with Blitz.js to format a nutritional label**
For our <a href="../../../io/template/">Impact Labels</a> create a TypeScript display process with <a href="https://blitzjs.com/">React Blitz.js for full stack Next.js</a>.&nbsp;  Here's a [Blank starter project for building TypeScript apps](https://stackblitz.com/edit/typescript) within [stackblitz.com](https://stackblitz.com)

4. **Help create a Blitz RealWorld starter site**
We are creating a <a href="https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=fullstack">RealWorld sample </a> for Blitz.js - Copy Prisma table structure file from [Prisma in NestJS sample](https://github.com/lujakob/nestjs-realworld-example-app/tree/prisma) when creating Blitz RealWorld sample in [blitz-realworld-example](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz-realworld-example) repo.
