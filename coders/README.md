### Today's Earthathon Focus

1.) Generating meal [images and video](/data-pipeline/research/stream/) from our Storyboard [.csv file prompts](https://github.com/modelearth/requests).
2.) Using [Open WebUI](/projects/src/) to load from our healthy menu [.csv files](https://github.com/modelearth/requests) by

[Visualizing meal ingredients](/data-commons/docs/food/) from [Meal  Request Storyboards](/requests) ([Github Fork](https://github.com/modelearth/requests)) in our [Open WebUI Projects Repo](/projects/src/) ([Github Fork](https://github.com/modelearth/projects))

[Get Started](/localsite/start/steps/) - Fork and cloning (and update) after forking our main repos.

<!--
Mark your calendar and join in our [Earth Day AI projects](/projects/)
-->
We'll be creating visual food nutrition labels and environmental impact biodiversity storyboards with our new generative AI tools for images and video using python and Open WebUI.<!--We'll use our Earthscape Chatbot UI fork to combine over 100 LLMs with Data Science visualizations. Real-time Natural language processing (NLP) processing of chats will pull locations, impact areas and UN goals for our chart output within cinematic page headers.-->
