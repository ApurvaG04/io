## Get Involved

Get started beforehand.  We need help in the following areas:  

1. Update timeline slider in OpenStreetMaps so earthquakes change as slider moves on <a href="https://model.earth/country-data/map/">3D Globe with Timeline</a>. Here's a version with [changing country boundaries](/mbgl-timeslider/demo/).

2. [Contact CoolClimate at Berkeley](https://coolclimate.berkeley.edu/calculator) to figure out which components can be shared and extended in embeddable [Impact Labels](/community/projects/#widgets). Integrate  environmental impact scoring tools with [international trade data](../../localsite/info/data/).

3. Add to our [interface in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/mVZUSQCMBsIMu9bp7Y8qsS/Neighborhood-Impact-Footprint?node-id=18%3A6) for showing everyone's real-time score for 24 impact areas. Install [Figma Unify](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1009866256233241860/Unify%3A-Figma-to-React%2C-React-Native-and-HTML%2FCSS) to convert Figma components into clean React.  
4. Explore [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) using our [Engine-Storybook](https://github.com/localsite/engine-storybook) repo.
