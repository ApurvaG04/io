## Get Involved

Get started beforehand.  We need help in the following areas:  

1. Create a Stable Diffusion image-generating app using <a href="https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/nextjs">Replicate.com NextJS</a> with OpenJourney and [Dreamlike](https://huggingface.co/dreamlike-art/dreamlike-photoreal-2.0)<!-- or the [Midjourney API](https://tokenizedhq.com/midjourney-api/)-->.

2. Save images to Github Actions and/or a CoLab script.

3. Automate pulling UN Comtrade input-output data using GitHub Actions to create static files to use with our global search filters. Our <a href="/data-pipeline/international/">International data prep</a> page  

4. Find and embed/fork existing [United Nations Comtrade data visualizations](https://comtradeplus.un.org/Visualization/Labs). 

5. Update timeline slider in OpenStreetMaps so earthquakes change as slider moves on <a href="https://model.earth/country-data/map/">3D Globe with Timeline</a>. Here's a version with [changing country boundaries](/mbgl-timeslider/demo/).

6. Integrate environmental impact scoring tools like [CoolClimate at Berkeley](https://coolclimate.berkeley.edu/calculator) with [Impact Labels](/community/projects/#widgets) and [international trade data](/data-pipeline/). 


## Open Source Generative Images for Job Creation

Our modeled images approximate reality as a tool for understanding international commerce. By combining UN import-export data with datasets trained using millions of international photos and illustrations. Midjourney prompts used are below images.
