## Get Involved

Get started beforehand.  We need help in the following areas:  

1. Create a Stable Diffusion image-generating app using <a href="https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/nextjs">Replicate.com NextJS</a>

2. Find and embed/fork existing [United Nations Comtrade data visualizations](https://comtradeplus.un.org/Visualization/Labs). 

3. Automate pulling UN Comtrade input-output data using GitHub Actions to create static files to use with our global search filters. Our <a href="/data-pipeline/international/">International data prep</a> page  

3. Update timeline slider in OpenStreetMaps so earthquakes change as slider moves on <a href="https://model.earth/country-data/map/">3D Globe with Timeline</a>. Here's a version with [changing country boundaries](/mbgl-timeslider/demo/).

4. Integrate environmental impact scoring tools like [CoolClimate at Berkeley](https://coolclimate.berkeley.edu/calculator) with [Impact Labels](/community/projects/#widgets) and [international trade data](/data-pipeline/).

Install [Figma Unify](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1009866256233241860/Unify%3A-Figma-to-React%2C-React-Native-and-HTML%2FCSS) to convert Figma components into clean React.
