	We need to figure out a crosswalk from the Naics6 department of labor data we pull for levels of employment, as it relates to the new 72 sectors the EPA now uses. Previously they used 389 sectors.  The sectors are a fairly close match to the naics values.

TO DO: [Update our state map filter](#geoview=country) with color levels like the [new report maps](https://figshare.com/collections/USEEIO_State_Models_v1_0_-_Supporting_Figures/7041473) from US EPA engineer Wes Ingwersen.

Hi State Partners,

I’m happy to share that our report, supporting figures and all the data files for v1.0 of the USEEIO State Models are now published. [View Report](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?dirEntryId=360453&Lab=CESER)

[Excel version of 2020 models](http://doi.org/10.23719/1530076) for all states:

We have files with models for all states for a given year in a native useeior Model format on a public server as well.

We have 100’s of supporting figures [including maps of the U.S.](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.7041473) showing environmental pressure intensity grouped by indicator and commodity for all states and rankings of sectors by consumption by environmental pressure for 2020.

Please review the materials and let Wes know if you have any questions.
 
[The industry comparisons](../localsite/info/) draw on our EPA data prepared and presented using useeior (R Language),  useeio.js and the [useeio-widgets](../io/charts/) (Javascript and HTML using the USEEIO-API). Let us know if you have priorities and interests there and could provide us with some interactive feedback (testing) as we put that together.

As a reminder (and mentioned in the report) we’re working on Consumption-based GHG inventories (CBEI) for Maine and other Northeast states as an application of these models but the functionalities we develop and describe will be available for all States. We anticipate that being completed by early summer.
