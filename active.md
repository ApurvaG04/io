<b>EV Challenge Statements</b>  

1. Where are concentrations of electric and hydrogen vehicle parts manufacturers emerging?  

2. Where are combustion vehicle manufacturers likely to be impacted?  

3. How can we improve the visualization of supply chain inflow and outflow for local impacts on jobs, value added and the environment?
